Net-FTPSSL version 0.07
=======================

Net::FTPSSL is an object oriented Perl module which implements a simple
FTP client over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS)
connection written following the directives described in RFC959 and RFC2228

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

TESTING

If you perform the "deeper test", it will generate a few log files to
help with troubleshooting whats going on.  Debug is turned on for
this test and written to a log file.  The generated files are:
   ./t/test_trace_log_new.txt    - The FTPSSL Debug log logging all FTP actions
   ./t/FTPSSL.pm_new.txt         - Test ascii file downloaded
   ./t/test_file_new.tar.gz      - Test binary file downloaded.

TROUBLESHOOTING

While support is very limited, a copy of the ./t/test_trace_log_new.txt file
generated by this test would be needed to analyze what went wrong with talking
to your particular FTPS server.

If these tests pass and it's your program that's failing, then I'd need a copy
of that program's trace log generated via:
          Net::FTPSSL->new(server, ..., Debug => 1);
