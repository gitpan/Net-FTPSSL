Revision history for Perl extension Net::FTPSSL.

Version - YYYY/MM/DD
--------------------

0.07 2009/02/24 08:30:00
  - Corrected some typos in the documentation.
  - Implemented call back functionality for all data channel functions.
  - Fixed uput() to return the file name used on success instead of just
    true/false.   Will still return "undef" on failure.  Needed in order to
    figure out what the other server actually called the file we sent it.
  - Exposed the DataProtLevel constants for public use.
  - Now uses caller() extensively to combine multiple similar functions together
    and for callback support.
  - Another fix to the get() bug introduced by the Bug 17537 fix.  The previous
    attempt in v0.06 didn't fully fix the problem!  So took different approach.
  - Enhanced t/10-complex.t & t/00-basic.t

  The following changes may break some existing code ...
  - Added new option 'Croak' to cause all failures to call croak() instead of
    returning undef.  This caused some minor incompatabilities on error handling
    if your code depended on some old croak() calls.  But the new code is now
    consistant in error handling in either always returning failure or always
    calling croak!  It no longer does a combination of both.
  - Added set_croak() to help mitigate above issue, by being able to turn the
    croak feature on & off.  t/10-complex.t uses this logic while initializing
    the connection.
  - user() & password() have been renamed since internal functions.

0.06 2009/02/03 08:30:00
  - Added new() DataProtLevel option to allow selecting the Data Channel Protection.
  - Fixed _help() so supported() works for some new servers.
  - new() now allows you to select SSL over TLS for connections via useSSL.
  - Fixed get() bug that sometimes added an extra \015 to ASCII files downloaded.
    Introduced when Bug 17537 was fixed.
  - Enhanced t/10-complex.t

0.05 2009/01/05 08:30:00
  - Fixed resonse() to properly get the entire response instead of just the 1st line of it.
    This change fixes many of the reported bugs reported against this module.
  - Fixed command() & response() to also log socket() calls in debug mode with "SKT >>>" & "SKT <<<" prefixes.
  - Added supported(), quot(), & _help()
  - All response calls in new() are now tested & added debug flag to socket object.
  - Enhanced t/10-complex.t
  - Other minor fixes.
  - Bugs Fixed: 41665, 31720, 16751, 30359, 24136, 17537, 17538, 34818
